# Fractional-Fourier-Low-Pass-Filter
Code for fractional Fourier low-pass filter for biomechanical motion data involving impacts (in Matlab)

This repository contains the scripts and functions required to process marker trajectories obtained from 3D motion analysis using the modified fractional Fourier filter method outlined in Augustus et al., (2020) JoB.

This code and supporting documentation was presented at the ISB/JSB XXIX Congress of International Society of Biomechanics (30th July to 3rd August)
